Brain Flashcards v.0.20 Second Big Edit 

All changes are caused by adding Bootstrap framework to the site, which significantly improves responsiveness and performance of the site, also makes it easier to create 
some elements and style them with ready-made classes. Documentation can be found in README.txt file

README.txt : Added file, in which we will find links to all needed documentation and we will find there all changes that occurred in website's code. 

app.css : Removed significant part of code what allowed to introduce Bootstrap. There is still a lot of work to do to make it look nice and neat. 

index.html: removed footer because we don't use it anyway, rest of the code transformed to use Bootstrap, which made the page finally responsive, added a menu which is also 
responsive and after shrinking it becomes a hamburger menu

Removed: stuff.txt

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Brain Flashcards v.0.21

app.css: Added some padding and resized some fonts for better readability on the page 

index.html: The menu from now on is glued to the page and slides down the page with us. Additionally I've changed and added borders to pictures, and in quizes and flashcards 
I've added temporary pictures to make work on the page easier 

Added: Changed all pictures to the same size, and added an overview board to make work easier 

Removed: Old photos with different sizes
